This is a 4 bit calculator designed and simulated in MULTISIM. It encorporates a 4 bit adder cum subtractor, universal shift registers and control circuitry to perform arithmetic operation on 2 4-bit binary numbers.
Multiplication and division utilise the "shift and add multiplication" and "restoring division" algorithms in "Structure of Computer Systems" by Baruch, Z. F.

OPCODEs for universal shift register:

00-No change

01-right shift

10-left shift

11-parallel load

Operations and their corresponding OPCODE:

00-ADD

01-SUBTRACT

10-MULTIPLY

11-DIVIDE
